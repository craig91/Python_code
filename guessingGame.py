# Write a function (guessing_game) that takes no arguments.

# When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

# Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.

# Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:

# Too high

# Too low

# Just right

# If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.

# The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.
